This is an implementation of NFA-based regular-expression matching in pure
python.  At the moment, it implements a small subset of the normal regular
expression syntax that only a mathematician would be satisfied with
(although it should sufficient to recognize all regular languages, doing so
wouldn't be any fun.)

It is not a finished product.  Everything about it is subject to change.  I
would recommend not using it for anything.

Any names, especially, are subject to change.

It is substantially inspired by [Russ Cox](http://swtch.com/~rsc/)'s
articles on [Implementing Regular Expressions](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/),
which you really should read if you find this code at all interesting.
